## Modes

Delta has 2 modes to suit each player.

**Single mode:** It's like in vanilla, you can play solo or with another multibox by switching with ALT TAB or other macros.

**Dual mode:** This mode allows you to play with yourself on a single page, making it much faster. Macros are available for automatic tricksplits. This uses the Rise system created by Zimek. Dual mode has many more features than Single mode.

## Single & Dual Functionalities
