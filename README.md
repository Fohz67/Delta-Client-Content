Single mode : It's like in vanilla, you can play solo or with another multibox by switching with ALT TAB / other macro

Dual mode : This mode allows you to play with yourself on a single page, making it much faster. Macros are available for automatic tricksplits. This uses the Rise system created by Zimek.
